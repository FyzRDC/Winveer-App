# Winveer-App
Always wanted to use Winveer on your Android phone but using a web browser is annoying and not really practical ?

I have the solution !
Discover : Winveer App, a fan-made android application developped in Kotlin using Android Studio.
A Simple apk file that you can download here 

⚠️️ When installing the application, you may see a warning from Google Play Store saying that the developper is not verified, its totally normal, I dont have any licenses required to publish google apps on the playstore and google don't like that.
